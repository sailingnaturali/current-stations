# current-stations

**NOAA CO-OPS tidal-current station data — the extractor, the schema, and the API's
undocumented behaviour, in one place.**

NOAA publishes harmonic constituents for **856 tidal-current stations** in US waters,
plus offset tables for **1,700-odd subordinate** stations. That is enough to predict slack
water and max flood/ebb offline, anywhere in US waters, with no network at runtime.

This package extracts that data, ships it as a versioned bundle, and documents the
schema — so you don't have to talk to the API at all.

## Install

```bash
npm install @sailingnaturali/current-stations
```

## Use it as a CLI

```bash
# every US current station → currents.json  (~2,800 stations, several minutes, paced)
npx current-stations extract currents.json

# one region
npx current-stations extract salish.json --box 47,-125,49.2,-122

# just the stations you care about
npx current-stations extract mine.json --stations PUG1717,PUG1701

# capture a validation fixture: constituents + NOAA's own predictions, one file
npx current-stations golden pug1741.json --station PUG1741 --bin 27 \
  --start 2026-07-19 --end 2026-07-21

# has NOAA's station list changed since the bundle was built? (one request; exit 1 if so)
npx current-stations check
```

> A full US extraction is ~2,800 paced requests and takes several minutes. NOAA
> throttles bulk callers — leave the pacing alone unless you have a reason.

## Use it as a library

```js
import { extractBundle, fetchCurrentPredictions, fetchHarcon } from '@sailingnaturali/current-stations';

// A bundle you can ship and predict from offline.
const { bundle, skipped } = await extractBundle({ stations: ['PUG1717'] });

// Or NOAA's own published predictions, live.
const events = await fetchCurrentPredictions(
  'PUG1717', 35, new Date('2026-07-19'), new Date('2026-07-21'),
);
// → [{ time: '2026-07-19T01:44:00.000Z', kind: 'flood', velocityMajor: 2.85, … }]
```

Ships TypeScript types. No dependencies.

## What a bundle looks like

```json

  "crossFlow": {
    "records": 856, "gte0_25kn": 61, "gte0_50kn": 12,
    "worstRatio": { "id": "BOS1130", "crossFlow": 0.178, "alongAxisPeak": 0.74, "ratio": 0.241 },
    "worstAbsolute": { "id": "PUG1619", "crossFlow": 0.8 }
  },
  "stations": [
    {
      "id": "PUG1717", "name": "Turn Point, Boundary Pass", "type": "harmonic",
      "floodDirection": 23.2, "ebbDirection": 203.2,
      "offset": 0.297,
      "constituents": [{ "name": "M2", "amplitude": 1.63, "phase": 295.3 }]

}
```

Speeds in knots, directions degrees true, time offsets in seconds. Full schema:
[schema/currents.schema.json](schema/currents.schema.json) ·
[docs/schema.md](docs/schema.md).

Four details that are easy to get wrong and expensive to debug:

- **`offset` is Z₀**, the station's net mean flow (NOAA `majorMeanSpeed`). Slack is
  where the velocity curve crosses zero, so dropping this moves every slack time. The
  Salish passes carry −0.74 to +0.30 kn of it. Measured cost of omitting it: **15.6 →
  7.4 min** mean timing error.
- **A reference is `(station, bin)`**, hence `SFB1201@10`. Constituents vary by depth
  bin and a station may publish several; keying by station id alone silently predicts
  from the wrong depth.
- **A `type: S` station is not necessarily subordinate.** A few carry their own harcon
  and NOAA predicts them harmonically; the offset reduction overshoots them badly
  (89 min vs 6.8 min at PUG1716). Rare — 1 of 1,706 — but you can't tell which without
  asking, and the ask is one request.
- **The model is one axis, and the bundle says how much that costs.** `crossFlow` is a
  census of NOAA's `minorMeanSpeed`, the flow perpendicular to the flood axis that runs
  even at slack. `validate` fails above a 0.5 ratio. Bundling the full minor axis was
  measured and rejected: a 2D magnitude series never crosses zero, so slack detection
  silently returns nothing.

## Maintenance

`currents.json` is committed, pretty-printed, so a change in NOAA's data is reviewable
as a diff. [`update-stations`](.github/workflows/update-stations.yml) keeps it current:

| Cadence | What runs | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly | pre-flight — **one** request for the station list | stations added, removed, or reclassified |
| Monthly | forced full extraction (~2,800 paced requests, ~25 min) | NOAA revising an existing station's constituents in place |

The weekly pre-flight only escalates to a full extraction when something moved, so the
common case costs a single request. Either way, a change opens a **pull request** with
the validation summary — nothing updates silently.

`stations.lock.json` pins the current list; `current-stations check` is the same
pre-flight you can run yourself, and exits non-zero on drift.

```bash
npx current-stations check                    # has NOAA's list moved?
npx current-stations validate currents.json   # structural check on a bundle
```

`validate` is what gates the automated PR: it fails on a subordinate whose reference
went missing, duplicate ids, a harmonic station with no constituents, or a bundle that
lost its Z₀ offsets — the shapes a truncated extraction takes.

## Don't trust it until you've diffed it

Both halves of a validation come from NOAA, so the check is self-contained: predict from
`harcon` constituents, compare against NOAA's own `currents_predictions` for the same
days. `current-stations golden` captures both into one fixture that replays offline.

Expect ~10 min / 0.05 kn at a clean reversing station. Measured results, realistic
tolerances, and the list of convention questions this method settled:
[docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md).

## Who uses this

- [slackwater-engine](https://github.com/sailingnaturali/slackwater-engine) — Swift tide
  and current engine; vendors the released bundle for offline prediction.
- [signalk-currents](https://github.com/sailingnaturali/signalk-currents) — SignalK
  plugin serving live and offline currents to a boat's instruments.

## Scope

US waters only — this is a NOAA client, and NOAA publishes US stations. Other national
hydrographic offices publish current data under their own terms; that is out of scope
here.

## If you're calling the NOAA API yourself

You probably don't need to — that's what the bundle is for. But if you are, the API has
undocumented behaviours that make the data look like it doesn't exist. The worst one:

```
GET /stations/PUG1701/harcon.json?bin=0   → { "HarmonicConstituents": [] }
GET /stations/PUG1701/harcon.json?bin=18  → 26 constituents
```

`bin=0` is the natural thing to try, and the empty array reads as "NOAA doesn't publish
current constituents." It does — at each station's `currbin`, and nowhere else.

**[→ docs/noaa-api.md](docs/noaa-api.md)** has the rest, including the widely-repeated
User-Agent-blocking claim that turns out **not** to be true.

## Licence and disclaimer

**Predictions derived from this data are UNOFFICIAL.** They are not NOAA products, they

timing at constricted passes can be off by 15 minutes or more. Use official published
