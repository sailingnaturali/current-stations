# Bundle schema

Machine-readable: [`schema/currents.schema.json`](../schema/currents.schema.json).

A bundle is `{ note, generated, stations[] }`. Every station is either **harmonic** (has
its own constituents) or **subordinate** (reduces against a harmonic reference).

Units throughout: **speeds knots**, **directions degrees true**, **time offsets
seconds**, **phases degrees Greenwich**.

## Harmonic station

```json
{
  "id": "PUG1717",
  "name": "Turn Point, Boundary Pass",
  "type": "harmonic",
  "floodDirection": 23.2,
  "ebbDirection": 203.2,
  "offset": 0.297,
  "constituents": [{ "name": "M2", "amplitude": 1.63, "phase": 295.3 }]
}
```

| Field | From NOAA | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | station id | `id` at the primary bin, **`id@bin`** for a reference at another bin |
| `floodDirection` | `azi` | major-axis azimuth — the flood set |
| `ebbDirection` | `azi + 180` | the reciprocal |
| `offset` | `majorMeanSpeed` | **Z₀**, signed net mean flow. Not optional — see below |
| `constituents[].amplitude` | `majorAmplitude` | knots (`units=english`) |
| `constituents[].phase` | `majorPhaseGMT` | Greenwich phase — pairs with a Greenwich V₀ |

### Predicting from it

Signed velocity along the major axis, at time *t*:

```
v(t) = Z₀ + Σ  fᵢ · Aᵢ · cos(ωᵢ·t + (V₀ᵢ + uᵢ) − φᵢ)
```

…the same sum-of-cosines as a tide station, with nodal corrections *f*, *u* applied as
usual. Then:

- **positive** velocity = flood, along `floodDirection`
- **negative** = ebb, along `ebbDirection`
- **max flood / max ebb** = the slope-zeros (extrema)
- **slack** = the **value**-zeros — where `v(t)` crosses zero

Label an extremum by the **sign of its velocity**, not by whether it's a curve high or
low. With Z₀ applied, a relaxation peak during a long ebb is a local maximum but is
still an ebb; NOAA labels it `maxEbb` and so should you.

That `Z₀` term is why slack is where it is. Drop it and every zero crossing moves —
measured at 15.6 min mean / 55 min worst error, versus 7.4 / 21 with it.

## Subordinate station

```json
{
  "id": "PCT0236",
  "name": "…",
  "type": "subordinate",
  "reference": "SFB1201@10",
  "floodDirection": 60, "ebbDirection": 240,
  "slackBeforeFloodOffset": -720,
  "slackBeforeEbbOffset": 480,
  "floodTimeOffset": -300,
  "ebbTimeOffset": 180,
  "floodSpeedRatio": 0.7,
  "ebbSpeedRatio": 1.2
}
```

Predict the **reference** station's events, then transform each:

| Event | Time shift | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| max flood | `+ floodTimeOffset` | `× floodSpeedRatio` |
| max ebb | `+ ebbTimeOffset` | `× ebbSpeedRatio` |
| slack before flood | `+ slackBeforeFloodOffset` | 0 |
| slack before ebb | `+ slackBeforeEbbOffset` | 0 |

Two traps:

- **Two slack offsets.** A slack takes the offset for the phase it *precedes* — which
  means you must know what follows it before you can place it.
- **Speed fields are ratios**, multipliers on the reference peak. Not deltas.

`reference` is a key into `stations[]` **including any `@bin` suffix**. Resolve it
exactly; a reference station may appear at several bins with different constituents.

## Not in the bundle

- **Type-W (weak and variable / rotary) stations.** NOAA doesn't publish a usable
  reversing model for them. The extractor counts them in `skipped.typeW` rather than
  emitting something misleading.
- **Subordinates whose reference didn't resolve.** Counted in `skipped.unresolvable`. A
  healthy full-US run drops zero.
- **Minor-axis constituents.** NOAA publishes `minorAmplitude`/`minorPhaseGMT` for a 2D
  rotary model; a major-axis model doesn't use them, so they aren't carried.
