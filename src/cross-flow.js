// What this package emits is a MAJOR-AXIS model: one signed speed along a fixed
// flood axis. NOAA also publishes `minorMeanSpeed` — the DC component of flow
// perpendicular to that axis, running at all times INCLUDING slack — and a
// major-axis model drops it.
//
// The per-station minor axis is deliberately not carried (docs/schema.md). But a
// bundle should be able to state the bound on its own approximation rather than
// leave it unmeasured, so the extractor records this census instead.
//
// Measured 2026-08-15. Across the 856 records a full US bundle holds: worst
// ratio 0.241 (BOS1130), worst absolute 0.80 kn (PUG1619 Marrowstone Point).
// The 0.241 also holds across the full 2,800 bin-records across NOAA's 850
// harmonic stations (not every bin at every one of NOAA's ~2,785 stations —
// subordinates have no harcon at all), so the bound below is safe for bins we
// don't currently take. Full investigation: openwatersio/slackwater-ios#102.
