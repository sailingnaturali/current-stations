// Detect drift in NOAA's current-station list.
//
// NOAA revises the list — stations get added, retired, or reclassified. That is not an
// error, but it must never be silent: a station appearing means the bundle is stale, and
// one disappearing means something downstream may reference a station that no longer
// exists. We went 855 → 856 harmonic between two extractions and only noticed by
// diffing bundles.
//
// This is deliberately cheap — ONE request for the station list, no per-station harcon
// fetches — so it can run on a schedule. It detects list-level drift (which stations
// exist, and their type). It does NOT detect a station's constituents being revised in
// place; that needs a full re-extraction and a bundle diff.
